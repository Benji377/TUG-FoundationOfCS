# Explanation of your solution

The Turing machine starts in the "Start" state and moves right until it encounters the "+" symbol. It then moves to the "Carry" state, handling any carry generated during addition. The "Add" state processes each bit, adding the corresponding bits and updating the tape. The machine moves left after encountering the "+" symbol, and when it finds a blank symbol, it transitions to the "End" state, marking the end of the computation.

If an overflow occurs during addition, the machine transitions to the "Overflow" state. The transition rules ensure that the machine processes each bit correctly, and the final tape contains the sum of the binary numbers with the cursor at the most significant bit.
