# Explanation of your solution

The Turing Machine starts with the State "Start" and then moves left until it encounters a 0 or a 1. If a 1 is encountered, it replaces it with a "y" and moves to the "Found1" state, else it moves to the "Found0" state. In both states, it moves left until it encounters a "+", after which it goes into the "Add1" sate if he previously was in the "Found1" state, else it goes into the "Add0" state. It will then move left until it encounters a number, do the addition and depending on the result, will go into Resu0, Resu1 or Resu2 state.
The number the cursor is currently on will be replaced wth an "x", then the cursor moves right until it encounters an "y". It then replaces the y with the result. Resu0 = 0, Resu1 = 1 and Resu2 = 0 with borrrow.
If no borrow occurs, the cursor goes back into the "Start" state and the process repeats itself. If a borrow occurs, the cursor doesn't go back into the start state until the borrow has been given back. The borrow can only be reset if it encounters a 0. If this doesn't happen, we have an overflow and we terminate the process.
In the end, when no numbers are left on the left side of the "+", the cursor goes into the clean state. This state goes to the farthest left of the tape and then goes right, replacing "x" and "+" with underscores. When it reaches a number, it stops and returns in the "End" state, which stops the machine.
